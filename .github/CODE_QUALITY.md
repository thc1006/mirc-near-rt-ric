# Code Quality Standards and Tools

This document outlines the code quality standards, tools, and processes for the O-RAN Near-RT RIC project.

## Overview

The project maintains high code quality through:
- Automated linting and formatting
- Code coverage requirements
- Security scanning
- Performance monitoring
- Comprehensive testing

## Code Quality Tools

### Go Backend

#### 1. golangci-lint
Configuration in `.golangci.yml`:
- **Enabled linters**: staticcheck, gosec, govet, ineffassign, misspell
- **Disabled linters**: gocyclo (too strict for telecom code)
- **Custom rules**: Function complexity < 15, file length < 1000 lines

#### 2. go vet
- Built-in Go tool for suspicious constructs
- Runs automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Fails build on any issues

#### 3. staticcheck
- Advanced static analysis for Go
- Detects bugs, performance issues, and style violations
- Zero tolerance policy in CI/CD

### Frontend (Angular/TypeScript)

#### 1. ESLint
Configuration in `.eslintrc.json`:
- **Angular-specific rules**: @angular-eslint/recommended
- **TypeScript rules**: @typescript-eslint/recommended
- **Accessibility rules**: @angular-eslint/template/accessibility

#### 2. Prettier
Code formatting:
- Automatic formatting on commit
- Consistent style across team
- Integration with VSCode

#### 3. Stylelint
SCSS/CSS linting:
- BEM methodology enforcement
- Color palette consistency
- Responsive design standards

## Security Standards

### 1. Dependency Scanning

#### Go Dependencies
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
go list -json -deps ./... | nancy sleuth

# Update dependencies
go get -u all
go mod tidy
```

#### npm Dependencies
```bash
# Audit npm packages
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

### 2. Static Security Analysis

#### gosec
- Security-focused linter for Go
- Detects common security issues
- CI/CD integration with SARIF output

#### Trivy
- Container vulnerability scanner
- File system scanning
- SARIF output for GitHub Security tab

### 3. Container Security

#### Best Practices
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base images (alpine, scratch)
- Multi-stage builds
- Security updates in base images

## Code Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Targets

| Component | Minimum Coverage | Target Coverage |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Go Backend | 80% | 90% |
| Angular Frontend | 75% | 85% |
| Integration Tests | 70% | 80% |

### Coverage Tools

#### Go Coverage
```bash
# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

#### Angular Coverage
```bash
# Jest with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Karma with coverage
ng test --code-coverage
```

## Performance Standards

### 1. Go Backend Performance

#### Benchmarks
- API response time < 100ms (p95)
- Memory usage < 512MB under normal load
- CPU usage < 50% under normal load

#### Profiling
```bash
# CPU profiling
go test -cpuprofile cpu.prof -bench .

# Memory profiling
go test -memprofile mem.prof -bench .
```

### 2. Frontend Performance

#### Metrics
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- Bundle size < 2MB

#### Tools
- Lighthouse CI
- Bundle analyzer
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

## Testing Standards

### 1. Unit Tests

#### Go Testing
- Minimum 80% line coverage
- Table-driven tests for complex logic
- Mock external dependencies

#### Angular Testing
- Component tests with TestBed
- Service tests with dependency injection
- Pipe and directive tests

### 2. Integration Tests

#### API Testing
- End-to-end API workflows
- Database integration tests
- Error handling scenarios

#### E2E Testing
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility testing

### 3. Performance Tests

#### Load Testing
- K6 for API load testing
- Concurrent user scenarios
- Resource utilization monitoring

## Continuous Integration

### 1. PR Requirements

All pull requests must:
- Pass all linting checks
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Pass security scans
- Include appropriate tests
- Have peer review approval

### 2. Branch Protection

Main branch protection:
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict push access

### 3. Automated Checks

CI pipeline includes:
- Code compilation/build
- Unit test execution
- Integration test execution
- Security scanning
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance regression testing

## Code Review Guidelines

### 1. Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact evaluated
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### 2. Review Focus Areas

#### Security
- Input validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Data encryption
- Logging sensitive data

#### Performance
- Algorithm efficiency
- Database query optimization
- Memory usage
- Network calls

#### Maintainability
- Code readability
- Function/class size
- Dependency management
- Documentation quality

## Metrics and Monitoring

### 1. Code Quality Metrics

- Technical debt ratio
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Duplication percentage
- Test coverage trends

### 2. Dashboard Integration

Quality metrics displayed in:
- GitHub repository insights
- Codecov dashboard
- SonarQube (if configured)
- Custom Grafana dashboards

## Tools Setup

### 1. Local Development

#### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
npm install
go mod download
make fix
```

#### Editor Configuration
- VSCode settings for consistent formatting
- EditorConfig for cross-editor consistency
- Extension recommendations

### 2. CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions
- Quality gates at each stage
- Parallel execution for speed
- Artifact storage for reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Coverage Drops
- Identify uncovered code
- Add missing tests
- Review coverage exclusions

#### 2. Linting Failures
- Run local linting
- Fix style violations
- Update configurations if needed

#### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- Review vulnerability details
- Update dependencies
- Apply security patches

### Resolution Steps

1. **Identify the issue** in CI/CD logs
2. **Reproduce locally** using same tools
3. **Fix the issue** following standards
4. **Verify the fix** with local testing
5. **Document** any configuration changes
